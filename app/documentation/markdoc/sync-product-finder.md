## Setup

Webstore data is currently loaded as needed, no need to wait for lengthy sync times!

To access your Neto Product Finder Content, navigate to the [Neto Addon Example Dashboard](/dashboard) and locate the Finder Overview widget. If you are not currently logged into your Neto Account you will be prompted to do so first.

The Finder Overview widget will check for a `finder` content type - this is usually `part-finder` but the application will do its best to locate one if its named slightly different. If a content type is found the total pages sycned will be displayed. To view any additional Finder pages and to see more information click the `View Finder` button.

This open the top level Finder contents. From there you can drill further into the Finder contents, up to a max of 3 levels.
