## Setup

Product data is currently loaded as needed, no need to wait for lengthy sync times!

To access your Neto product data, navigate to the [Neto Addon Example Dashboard](/dashboard) and locate the Products Overview widget. If you are not currently logged into your Neto Account you will be prompted to do so first.

The Products Overview widget will list the number of products currently synced. To view more information click the `View Products` button.
