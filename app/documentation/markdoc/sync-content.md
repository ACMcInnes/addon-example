## Setup

Webstore data is currently loaded as needed, no need to wait for lengthy sync times!

To access your Neto content data, navigate to the [Neto Addon Example Dashboard](/dashboard) and locate the Contents Overview widget. If you are not currently logged into your Neto Account you will be prompted to do so first.

The Contents Overview widget will list the main for Neto content types: Categories, Web/Info Pages, Blogs, Brands as well as the number of pages currently synced for each type. To view any additional content types and to see more information click the `View Content` button.

This will provide a full rundown of all pages under each content type, including the page Name, ID, Content Path, and if the page is currently Active.
